/*
Ceil from BST
Ninja is given a binary search tree and an integer. Now he is given a particular key in the tree and returns its ceil value. Can you help Ninja solve the problem?
Note:
Ceil of an integer is the closest integer greater than or equal to a given number.
For example:
arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}, key = 3.
The closest integer greater than 3 in the given array is 5. So, its ceil value in the given array is 5.
Sample Input 1:

2
8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
4
8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
7

Sample Output 1:

5
7

Explanation for Sample Output 1:

 In the first test case, we traverse the tree starting from the root node which has a value of 8. Now the value of its left child is 5 and its right child is 10. Key-value 4 is less than the left child so we traverse the left subtree. Now we reach a node with value 5 and then again repeat the above process till we reach a null node. Finally, we return 5 as our answer.

In the second test case, we traverse the tree starting from the root node which has a value of 8. Now the value of its left child is 5 and its right child is 10. Key-value 7 is less than the right child and more than the left child, so we traverse the right subtree. Now we reach a node with value 10 and then again follow the same procedure and reach a node with value 7 and stop there and return 7 as our final answer.
