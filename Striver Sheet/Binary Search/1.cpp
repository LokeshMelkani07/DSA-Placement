/*
Median of Row Wise Sorted Matrix
Problem Statement: Given a row-wise sorted matrix of size r*c, where r is no. of rows and c is no. of columns, find the median in the given matrix.

Assume â€“ r*c is odd

Examples:

Example 1:
Input:
r = 3 , c = 3
1 4 9
2 5 6
3 8 7
Output: Median = 5
Explanation: If we find the linear sorted array, the array becomes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
So, median = 5

Example 2:
Input:
r = 3 , c = 3
1 3 8
2 3 4
1 2 5
Output: Median = 3
Explanation: If we find the linear sorted array, the array becomes 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 7 8
So, median = 3
