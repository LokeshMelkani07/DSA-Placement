// Most of patterns has 2 loops
// outer loop for rows
// inner loops for the coulmns

// Steps
// Count the number of lines (rows) for the outer loop.
// For the inner loop, focus on the cols and connect them somehow to the rows
// Do the printing work inside the inner for loop
// Observe symmetry.
