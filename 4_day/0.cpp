// Time and space complexity
/*
Time taken by the algo based on function of length of input
For making better program we need to have knowledge of time and space complexity
To compare any 2 algos we need to have knowledge of time & space complexity

10^8 operation rule
All modern machines can execute any program in 10^8 operation/seconds

Space Complexity
Extra space taken by our algo as function of length of the input
variables do not contribute to space complexity
int arr[5] has constant SC but int arr[n] where n = input taken by user takes o(n) SC
Any loop running n times do not contribute to SC, it only contributes to TC
